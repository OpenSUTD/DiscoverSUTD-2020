                        <p>Dear respected staff, faculty members and Class of 2024 undergraduate students,<br><br>

                            I am James from the DiscoverSUTD 2020 Organizing Committee, and we would like to sincerely apologise for the technical difficulties that were experienced during the Pillar Talks for DiscoverSUTD 2020 on 17 September 2020. Pillar selection is an important decision for Freshmores and hence we think that an adequate post-mortem is necessary and to highlight next steps.
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Deciding on the streaming provider</p>
                        <ol type="1" start="1">
                            <li>Livestreams (and uploading the Fifth Row Showcase videos as well) need to be conducted in a closed manner. This would mean that a login wall is required. An unlisted video on YouTube, for example, would not suffice since anyone in the public would still be able to view the embedded version on the DiscoverSUTD website. Microsoft Stream provides an easy integration to this since SUTD’s email accounts are managed on the Microsoft Outlook platform.</li>
                            <li>Video conferencing allow all users to speak. MS Teams allow meeting organizers to mute all participants. However, participants are able to unmute themselves.</li>
                            <li>Teams meetings allow for people to join via invite links, including members of the public. Since the event is targeted at Freshmores, we do not want people who are not involved hopping in and out, disrupting the event. Although there are permissions allow people to either bypass the lobby or be required to wait to be admitted, it is logistically taxing to check whether the participant is invited or not.</li>
                            <li>Video conferencing requires sign-ups. This allows for the organizer to send out invite links. Since we are not limited by space in a virtual event, as compared to a physical event due to COVID-19 safe-distancing measures, an unlimited number of students can attend the talk. However, sign ups create an unnecessary hassle.</li>
                            <li>Unlike classes where participants are limited and are mandated to join the lesson, we think livestreams provide us with the control for events where the target audience is constrained but participation count is not pre-determined. Freshmores are able to join in if they decide to do so at the last minute and disruption to the event is minimized, especially for an online event. The login requirement for MS Stream also prevents public viewing of the livestream.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><em>However, considering that Microsoft Stream was fairly untested for larger sizes, it was hard to tell if it would successfully execute the pillar talks. The features of integrating this to Freshmore e-mails would also aid in the management of the event.</em></p>
                        <p style="text-decoration: underline;">IT testing</p>
                        <p>This format was tested twice:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>7 September 2020, 1255hrs – 1700hrs: 4 livestreams ran concurrently from our respective homes  and we streamed from our own personal laptops. No issues with streams.</li>
                            <li>14 September 2020, 2255hrs – 0030hrs (of the next day): We conducted this in SUTD Hostel’s Block 55 Quiet Study Room, utilizing both SUTD_Wifi and the loaned laptops from IT. We encountered some minor hiccups but we managed to livestream from 4 out of the 5 loaned laptops, 3 of which we used for the actual Pillar Talks.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><em>Therefore, the team evaluated that this format would probably work on the actual day. What was not accounted for was that traffic would be at least x50 times more. Yet, this cannot be adequately simulated.</em></p>
                        <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Recordings</p>
                        <p>In order to preserve the Pillar Talks, the livestreams were recorded.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>ASD: laptop crashed and laptop could no longer be switched on. See <em>Appendix</em> for images.</li>
                            <li>EPD: recording was only saved 40 minutes into the talk.</li>
                            <li>ISTD: no issue.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><em>There was too much reliance on a single source of the recording. However, considering that the stream did not work, another laptop could not have recorded concurrently either.</em></p>

                        <p>The following actions are done in consultation with the respective Pillars:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>ASD: we will be uploading a recording of ASD’s previous outreach event during Singapore Virtual University Fair (original source from <a href="https://youtu.be/LSTBfbOL9Dk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). Even though the target audience is different, the essentials of a more in-depth introduction of Architecture as a study and career are still there.</li>
                            <li>EPD: we will be uploading a “simulated recording” of the actual talk. Since we have the audio intact, we will recreate the recording using the slides that EPD has prepared for the Pillar Talk. We would also provide a list of the presenters on the website under the EPD’s recording section, with hyperlinks directing to their respective profiles on SUTD’s website.</li>
                        </ul>

                        </header>
                        <ol type="1" start="1">
                            <li>Utilise Zoom as it has proven to be a much more reliable format. However, signups will have to be gated. The Zoom Webinar feature will suffice and can hold up to 100 participants but a subscription is required.</li>
                            <li>Better contingency planning in the event of stream failures could have been done.</li>
                            <li>All material and preparation should be done on the day before including the submission of sli.do link and presentation slides for Pillar Talks so that Freshmores can still get the information to be disseminated.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Once again, I would like to sincerely apologize for the technical difficulties that were faced. We seek your kind understanding on the matter and hope to grow from this experience together.<br><br>

                            Thank you.<br><br>

                        <p>DiscoverSUTD is a 3-weeks long introduction to the SUTD community for the incoming Freshmores. It is organised by a team formed by the two SUTD Freshmore 2019 Reps, with assistance and guidance from the OpenSUTD team. It is a joint effort by more than a hundred SUTDents, faculty, researchers, staff and alumni, and collaboratively planned and executed on <b>OpenSUTD</b>, an open organisation owned by the SUTD community.</p>
