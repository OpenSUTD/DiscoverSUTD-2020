# DiscoverSUTD-2020

**DiscoverSUTD 2020 Main Repository**

This repository hosts the microsite's source code for DiscoverSUTD 2020 and it also serves for decentralized planning for the SUTD Freshmore 2020 experience.

## Introduction

DiscoverSUTD is a 3-weeks long introduction to the SUTD community for the incoming Freshmores. It is conducted on 14 September 2020 - 2 October 2020.

DiscoverSUTD is organised by a team formed by the two SUTD Freshmore 2019 Reps, with assistance and guidance from the OpenSUTD team.

It is a joint effort by more than a hundred SUTDents, faculty, researchers, staff and alumni, and collaboratively planned and executed on OpenSUTD.

Emphasis is on personal agency to allow for self-discovery of SUTD’s ecosystem.

OpenSUTD is modelled after the idea of an Open Organisation and we have community standards for all members to abide by in order to ensure a good environment for members to learn and contribute effectively. An Open Organization is one that engages participative communities both inside and out; responds to opportunities more quickly, has access to resources and talent outside the organization, and inspires, motivates, and empowers people at all levels to act.

We intend to adhere to these principles:

1. Equitable - Fifth Rows that want to do a workshop will have the chance to, especially if there is a proven track record of doing excellent sessions.
2. Fair - all workshops conducted well should be supported.
3. Incentivise right behaviour - we should provide funds to encourage a more hands-on approach, quality instructors, and well-prepared material.

We’d like to support Fifth Rows in reaching out to the Freshmores but also to help Freshmores make sense of what Fifth Rows suit them best. Specifically through clear communication and categorising our workshops into tracks based on skills taught.

Our objectives:

1. For Freshmores: understand the spaces (virtual and physical), avenues for resources and communities in SUTD in order to embody the desired culture embodying the spirit of innovation, collaboration, having self-initiated projects, self-directed learning and broad-based skill integration.
2. For SUTD: celebrate the work done by our research community, 5th Rows and Housing (specifically amongst seniors). Showcase the potential of UROPs and taking up research projects in SUTD, similar to LCC in an interactive/experiential manner.

## Contributing

The general workflow is as follows:

1. Submit a proposal by issuing a GitHub Issue [here](https://github.com/OpenSUTD/DiscoverSUTD-2020/issues/new/choose). You are recommended to choose one of the Issue Templates provided there.
2. Our custom Microsoft Power Automate [Flow](assets/planning/workflow.png) will be automatically fired and our team will be notified of the issue and its information via our main DiscoverSUTD group email.
3. Someone from our team will reply to your issue and review it for approval.
4. Once the details are reviewed and cleared, you will get a notification.
5. Depending on whether you’re proposing a session for an event or making a suggestion for improvement, the workflow will then diverge and become tailored to the specific issue.

## Timeline

Check the [DiscoverSUTD calendar](https://discover.opensutd.org/calendar.html) for the latest timeline of compulsory events for the incoming SUTD Freshmores.

This timeline is to assist Fifth Row leaders for planning purposes. Ensure that your event's timing/venue does not clash with the compulsory events or with another existing event in the calendar. Due to the current COVID-19 situation, arrangements might be more volatile, uncertain and fluctuating, so please take note of any possible last-minute changes! All latest updates will be reflected in this repository.

## Contact Us

If you have any enquiries, contact us preferably [here](mailto:discover@sutd.edu.sg) or you can also contact the Freshmore 2019 Reps [here](mailto:freshmore@rep.sutd.edu.sg).

Try to keep discussions more open and formal by using either GitHub (feel free to raise a custom issue or even a PR!) or email (if there are sensitive details...) so that we can respond promptly, properly and more smoothly for the sake of everyone involved.

Try not to utilize more personal communication platforms such as Telegram or WhatsApp since we might be less responsive there. If you personally know any of the DiscoverSUTD 2020 team members, feel free to informally bump up, direct attention to or notify about certain issues if necessary, but try to keep it to a minimum so as to keep everyone involved in the loop, in touch and updated with the latest plans (especially during this COVID-19 period).

For urgent matters and correspondences, you can try contacting the two Freshmore Reps personally ([here](mailto:amelia_yeo@mymail.sutd.edu.sg) or [here](mailto:jiawei_chua@mymail.sutd.edu.sg)). Alternatively, if they are busy (i.e. have not replied your enquiry in 24 hours), contact me directly [here](mailto:james_raphael@mymail.sutd.edu.sg). I will try my very best to respond to you ASAP, as long as I'm not sleeping. Although, I still urge you to use our [main DiscoverSUTD email](mailto:discover@sutd.edu.sg), if possible.
