# DiscoverSUTD-2020

**DiscoverSUTD 2020 Main Repository**

This repository hosts the microsite's source code for DiscoverSUTD 2020 and it also serves for decentralized planning for the SUTD Freshmore 2020 experience.

## Introduction

DiscoverSUTD is a 4-weeks long introduction to the SUTD community for the incoming Freshmores. It is estimated to be conducted on 13 September 2020 - 10 October 2020.

DiscoverSUTD is organised by a team formed by the two SUTD Freshmore 2019 Reps, with assistance and guidance from the OpenSUTD team.

OpenSUTD is modelled after the idea of an Open Organisation and we have community standards for all members to abide by in order to ensure a good environment for members to learn and contribute effectively.

## Contributing

The general workflow is as follows:
1. Submit a proposal by issuing a GitHub Issue [here](https://github.com/OpenSUTD/DiscoverSUTD-2020/issues/new/choose). You are recommended to choose one of the Issue Templates provided there.
2. Our custom Microsoft Power Automate [Flow](assets/planning/workflow.png) will be fired and our team will be notified of the issue via our main DiscoverSUTD email.
3. Someone from our team will reply to your issue and review it.
4. Once the details are reviewed and cleared, you will get a notification.
5. Depending on whether you’re proposing a session for an event or making a suggestion for improvement, the workflow will then diverge and become tailored to the specific issue.

## Timeline

(This timeline is to assist Fifth Row leaders for planning purposes. Due to the current COVID-19 situation, arrangements might be more volatile, uncertain and fluctuating, so please take note of any possible last-minute changes! All latest updates will be reflected in this repository.)

Coming soon!

## Contact Us

If you have any enquiries, contact us preferably [here](mailto:discover@sutd.edu.sg) or you can also contact the Freshmore 2019 Reps [here](mailto:freshmore@rep.sutd.edu.sg).

Try to keep discussions more open and formal by using either GitHub (feel free to raise a custom issue or even a PR!) or email (if there are sensitive details...) so that we can respond promptly, properly and more smoothly for the sake of everyone involved.

Try not to utilize more personal communication platforms such as Telegram or WhatsApp since we might be less responsive there. If you personally know any of the DiscoverSUTD 2020 team members, feel free to informally bump up, direct attention to or notify about certain issues if necessary, but try to keep it to a minimum so as to keep everyone involved in the loop, in touch and updated with the latest plans (especially during this COVID-19 period).

For urgent matters and correspondences, you can try contacting the two Freshmore Reps personally ([here](mailto:amelia_yeo@mymail.sutd.edu.sg) or [here](mailto:jiawei_chua@mymail.sutd.edu.sg)). Alternatively, if they are busy (i.e. have not replied your enquiry in 24 hours), contact me directly [here](mailto:james_raphael@mymail.sutd.edu.sg). I will try my best to respond to you ASAP, as long as I'm not sleeping. Although, I still urge you to use our [main DiscoverSUTD email](mailto:discover@sutd.edu.sg), if possible.
