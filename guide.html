                <p><strong>DiscoverSUTD</strong> is a <strong>3-weeks long introduction to the SUTD community</strong>. It is conducted on 14 September 2020 - 2 October 2020. This event is collaboratively brought to you by the various
                    Fifth Rows, faculty, pillars, departments (which include SUTD Housing) and research laboratories in SUTD.</p>
                <p>The main event page serves as the <strong>starting point for your SUTD journey</strong>. Within this page, there is a community calendar, session sign-ups and speaker biographies for our flagship event, the SUTD Human Library.</p>
                <p>Now, before you continue, you are <em>highly recommended</em> to bookmark this page! This guide will be updated continuously as we receive feedback throughout the event. Through this guide, you will be able to learn more about what
                    SUTD can offer.</p>

                <p>A <strong>Human Library</strong> allows <strong>YOU</strong> to borrow &#34;books&#34;. These books are real people: faculty, staff, researchers and seniors. When you borrow a book, you sit down with them and have a conversation about
                    their experiences both inside and outside of SUTD.</p>
                <p class="image-container"><img style="width: 428.50px" src="/assets/media/images/human_library.jpeg"></p>
                <p>Every single book will have a <strong>bio</strong> that gives you an idea of what conversation topics you might expect! You can read all the bios right <a href="https://discover.opensutd.org/people.html"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>here</strong></a> and find out where your favourite book is seated at the event venue (to be confirmed).</p>
                <p>Among the 20+ books include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Senior Management, including Associate Provosts</li>

                <p>Food is one of the things that matter to us the most! Within the school, there are a few eateries that students go to if they fancy something outside the canteen.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>GomGom</strong> (Sub/Sandwich Cafe)<br>Opening Hours: 9am to 8pm (Mon-Fri) 12pm to 6pm (Sun).</li>

                </ul>
                <p>A couple of restaurants at <strong>Changi City Point</strong> (CCP) offers food at prices that are friendlier for students. CCP is within walking distance, one MRT stop away (Expo MRT). There is also a shuttle bus that runs at
                    30-minute intervals (starting at 11:15am and ending at 7:45pm).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Soup Spoon Union<br></strong>Offers student meals at $6.90.<br>Student meal hours: Mondays to Fridays, until 6:30pm.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wolf Burgers<br></strong>Burgers and a meal at 10% student discount.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Fancy heading out a bit further? Want to treat yourself to a job well done? A mere two MRT stops away (and with no transfers required) is Tampines, with the following excellent, if a bit hard on your wallet, food places:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>iSteaks<br></strong>Estimated Price: About 15-20 dollars per person, including drinks.</li>

            <google-codelab-step label="Getting Around Campus" duration="5">
                <h3>TL;DR</h3>
                <p>The format of the room code is <strong>[Building].[Floor][Room]</strong>. For example, <em>1.308</em> references a room in <em>Building 1, Level 3, Room 8</em>, which happens to be <strong>TT1</strong>.</p>

                <h3>Details</h3>
                <p>After some time in school, you would realise that rooms in our school are often referred to using code numbers (e.g., 2.716, 3.109 or 5.401). Here&#39;s a quick breakdown of what this code means to ease getting yourself around:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>(<strong>#</strong>.___): The number at the left of the decimal represents the building where the room may be found.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Building 1 is where the SUTD Library may be found.</li>
                        <li>Building 2 is where the Campus Centre may be found.</li>
                        <li>Building 3 is opposite the Campus Centre, where Gong Cha may be found.</li>
                        <li>Building 5 is where the Fab Lab may be found.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>(_.<strong>###</strong>): For the number at the right of the decimal, the first digit represents the floor where the building may be found, while the other two numbers represent the room number.</li>
                    <li>For rooms located at the <strong>SUTD Hostel</strong> and the <strong>Sports and Recreation Centre</strong> area, the building number would have two digits representing the block number and therefore, the code number format would
                        be <strong>(##.###)</strong>. For example, the <strong>Housing Management Office</strong> is located at <em>59.191</em>.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Block 55 would be the hostel block furthest from the campus.</li>
                        <li>Block 57 would be where the Student Lounge is located.</li>
                        <li>Block 59 would be the hostel block nearest to the campus.</li>
                        <li>Block 61 would be where the <a href="https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Campus-Life/Sports-and-Recreation-Centre" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sports and Recreation Centre</a> is located.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                    <p>
                    <p>Fun fact: There is no Building 4 in SUTD. Try to figure out why! It&#39;s a pretty common reason in Southeast Asia.</p>
                </aside>
                <p>Also, if you need to go across buildings, the following levels are interconnected in this fashion:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Level 2: The second floor of the Campus Centre links Buildings 2 and 3.</li>
                    <li>Level 3: The roof area above the Campus Centre links Buildings 1, 2 and 3. An additional link bridge links Buildings 1 and 2 in the middle of Building 1. A final link bridge hidden along Building 1 links Buildings 1 and 5.</li>
                    <li>Level 5: The link bridge roof is walkable and links Buildings 1 and 2.</li>
                </ul>

            <google-codelab-step label="Getting the Most Out of SUTD" duration="5">
                <p>Time is short in SUTD and 4 years can pass by you in a flash. Here are some suggestions to help you get the most out of your time here in SUTD.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Know what you want to get out of SUTD.</strong> Be it a career path, a good social circle, or technical skills. This will help inform the choices you make, and help you prioritise what matters to you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Appreciate the value of time. </strong>Your time is finite, and every choice has an opportunity cost to yourself and others. Make your choice clear to both.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be reasonable to the people giving you the opportunity and be clear about your level of commitment.</strong> There are too many opportunities in SUTD, and most of them might be tempting. It is alright to explore, but be
                        responsible!</li>
                    <li><strong>When it comes to commitments, aim for quality over quantity.</strong> You will be unable to gain much if you take on too many things. It is recommended to be part of a maximum of up to 2 Fifth Rows and 1 active UROP only.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Finish what you start!</strong> Being responsible not only helps you build up a portfolio of complete projects, it also helps establish you as a reliable team member and helps with finding and building teams.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be mindful of how you conduct yourself.</strong> SUTD is small and news spreads quickly. It is very easy to be famous or infamous for the way you carry yourself and how you treat your commitments.</li>
                </ul>


            </google-codelab-step>

            <google-codelab-step label="Acquiring Technical Skills" duration="5">
                <p>The SUTD curriculum provides you with robust theoretical foundations and bare minimum practical foundations, which might not be sufficient for thriving in the working world. And in fact, many of the more &#34;applied&#34; courses occur
                    late in your undergrad career (Term 6 onwards). This is <strong>after</strong> your internship opportunities and about the time when you begin your job hunt.</p>
                <p><strong>In our experience, projects and technical skills can weigh far more heavily than grades can. It is important to avoid focusing solely on grades, as it is very important to bolster your knowledge with practical and technical
                    skills for the career path you at looking for.</strong></p>
                <p>As such you should be prepared to develop your skills during your own time:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Utilise extra-curricular opportunities, such as technical Fifth Rows</li>
                    <li>Self-learn from freely available resources on the Internet</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We recommend to spend Term 1 joining a UROP or specialist clubs and societies to try to bolster your skills! Take advantage of the lower academic pressure to invest in your technical abilities. Remember, no matter how well or badly you
                    do, every grade is still recorded as a &#39;PASS&#39; in Term 1.</p>
                <p>Then, with a foundation, start diving into a deeper project or discipline in Term 2 immediately. Pillar years can get quite hectic, and many students find they no longer have the time to spend self-learning technical skills then. Your
                    Freshmore year is really the best time to get a firm technical foundation!</p>
                <p>That said, don&#39;t go around failing subjects! Grades are still relevant. They help you to open up a lot of opportunities in school (like exchange programmes), and are important for pursuing further studies as well as qualifying for
                    careers in certain sectors (particularly the Government and Academia sectors).</p>
                <h2 is-upgraded="">Doors are always open!</h2>
                <p>In SUTD, the faculty and staff are always willing to engage with students. Email professors directly if you&#39;re interested in their work or if you have an interesting idea and need some help.</p>
                <p>Outside of school, you&#39;ll often realise that people are pretty welcoming as well. Don&#39;t be afraid to cold call companies for opportunities such as internship or mentorship. It is common for students to get better responses from
                    contacting the company directly compared to using the official career portal.</p>

            <google-codelab-step label="Research Opportunities" duration="5">
                <p>At SUTD, plenty of opportunities for people of different interests are available, and those with a keen desire to do research work will find that plenty of research opportunities are abound. During the first few weeks in school, we
                    would like to nudge you to think about topics you are interested in, do a bit of your own research/reading, and figure out if you would like to pursue it as a UROP!</p>
                <h2 is-upgraded=""><strong>Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme (UROP)</strong></h2>
                <p>Funding: Up to $1500 per project.</p>
                <p>UROPs are the main source of research opportunities for undergraduate students. There are 2 ways that one can join an UROP:</p>
                <ol type="1" start="1">
                    <li>Applying for a project listed by a Professor/Faculty member on MyPortal. Students are to contact project supervisors to discuss the details of the project before applying.<img style="width: 624.00px"
                        src="/assets/media/images/urop.png"></li>
                    <li>No projects to suit your fancy? Pitch your own project! At SUTD, the professors and faculty are more than willing to support/guide students in their own initiated projects. If you have an idea that you feel is worth exploring, but
                        lack the guidance and financial support to do so, a self-initiated UROP is always a good idea.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2 is-upgraded=""><strong>IDC-UROP</strong></h2>
                <p>Funding: Up to $2000 per student in project group.</p>
                <p>Have an idea you&#39;re super keen on exploring, but UROP funding is insufficient? Consider applying for a self-initiated project with the International Design Centre. Some examples of ongoing IDC-UROPs can be found <a
                    href="https://idc.sutd.edu.sg/current-urop-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> (they are slightly outdated though).</p>
                <p>Of course, all funding comes at a price. IDC-UROPs require a detailed proposal and a comprehensive final report detailing the full scope, methods and findings of the project upon the conclusion of the UROP (only good practice, really).
                </p>
                <p>Watch out for an email from IDC for an open call for new UROP proposals.</p>
                <aside class="notice">
                    <p><strong>Extra Note</strong></p>
                    <p>For IDC-UROP, you can only get a <strong>maximum of $2000</strong> IDC-UROP funding (for yourself) for your entire school career as an individual. Normal UROPs are not limited in this regard.</p>
                    <p>However, exceptions can be made at IDC&#39;s discretion.</p>

            <google-codelab-step label="Managing the Workload in SUTD" duration="5">
                <p>It is not uncommon to have multiple assignments due in the same week (or day), along with multiple project checkpoints or submissions in certain weeks (often right before or after recess week). You should mentally prepare yourself for
                    the workload.</p>
                <p>Here are some tips to help manage the workload:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not be complacent. Be fully prepared to put in consistent effort.</li>
                    <li>It is very easy to fall behind by accident, and the pace of the curriculum makes it even harder to catch up. Don&#39;t think that you can &#34;catch up later&#34;.</li>
                    <li>Putting in work early helps you prevent late or even sleepless nights. However, things break, and this means you might need to stay up to fix things.</li>
                    <li>It helps to keep a to-do list on hand to help keep track of your tasks.</li>
                    <li>Manage your academics with your peers! Grab dinner at CCP with your friends or play some multiplayer games to de-stress, but do it in moderation.</li>
